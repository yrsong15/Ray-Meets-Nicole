      <p>
        This was supposed to be a story about our adventures in <span>The Big Apple</span>, if anyone still calls New York by that outdated nomenclature. It was basically planned out to be a Chapter 6. But I've changed my mind and turned it into an epilogue - it's the last chapter of this book for the time being, so I surely felt that there's a better way to close this off.
