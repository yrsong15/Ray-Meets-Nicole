        Ever since I was a young boy, my calendar has always had two stars: my birthday and Christmas Day. There's something about Christmas that stirs up a sense of <span class="hl">festivity</span> from deep within, which is why I start feeling giddy as soon as the month of December begins its countdown. This is a story about our first Christmas and New Years Eve.

        After four months' worth of whirlwinds, Nicole and I were safely reunited in Korea. We'd thought that long-distance had finally come to a temporary halt, until we realized that even within the relatively small Korean peninsula, we lived two hours apart. The biting winter winds didn't help, either, but by that time we were already so fed up with distance being a barrier that anything within driving distance seemed to be a feasible option. And so began the four-hour daily commutes, fatigue notwithstanding, <span class="hl">just because we could.</span>

        Our first date back in Korea began with a small pleasantry from my mom: Christmas soap! (This might explain my almost zealous passion towards Christmas; it's in the blood.) Much of the day was spent roaming the streets of Daejeon. Disclosure: it wasn't just this day, but most of winter break spent roaming the very city. And our efforts obviously paid off - we have proof. A lot of it.

        The picture below is one of my all-time favorites, one that wasn't planned out in any way but really representative of who we are: fun-loving, random, and rather cute, to be honest. It was taken while we were shopping for absolutely nothing - I guess <span class="hl">it was who it was with that mattered</span>, not where we were or what we did.

        One of the more memorable nights was when Nicole came to Seoul for a night out in 청계천, a waterway adorned by lights come wintertime. I distinctly remembered the shining decorations from when I was 12 years old, when our family had came to the exact same spot to take pictures with abysmal cameras on the now-antique folder phones.
