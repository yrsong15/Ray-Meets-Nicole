      <h1 class="title">Chapter Four: Back At It Again</h1>

      <p>
        Fall semester was when we had established who we were and what we did. Spring semester was when we fully lived the world we had created. You can bet that many rules were broken along the way.
      </p>

        Spring semester was supposed to be much more lax than its fall counterpart, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that we had taken the entire semester to settle in. As a result, Nicole had secured an internship, I had adjusted back to college life, and the path to a quiet 4 months seemed to be paved out for us. <span class="hl">How naive.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, long-distance was the name of the game. Flowers and perfume did their share of the magic, but obviously no amount of material gifts could make up for the fact that we weren't physically together. Interestingly enough, these beautiful pictures of Nicole somehow belie the hardship that we had endured all throughout winter - just sit and watch.

        The numbing cold was definitely getting to Nicole, who disliked even the slightest hint of chills in the air. The quarter system dealt its blow as well, which meant that she would be <span class="hl">taking final exams as I was preparing for my first midterm.</span> I myself was going through a combination of tough coursework and the strain of securing something for my own summer plans, which led to its own share of anxiety.

        But this semester was unlike the last one in that for once, our school schedules had finally aligned, and we would end up spending two whole weeks together, the first half in the city of our choice (the second half was to be spent in Durham due to my spring break concluding much earlier than hers). That location, as was decided back in October, was none other than Miami, headlined by the three-day <span class="hl">Ultra Miami 2016</span>, also known as the <span class="hl">biggest party in the world</span> (or one of them, at least, but you know how slogans go). By no means were the tickets cheap, but we figured that it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime things that had to be done when we had the time and energy.

        The trip started off surprisingly smooth on <span class="hl">March 18, 2016</span>. Our AirBnB host was extremely gracious, much more than what we'd expected, which really made us feel home. Upon first meeting her in a fashion district, she showed us around a rather fancy exhibit, followed by a late-night tour of the shoreside hotels on our way back home. The place itself was of impressive quality as well, especially considering how they were essentially one-fifth of the price we would have had to paid in hotels. The downside was distance, but we felt that a 20-minute drive from the UMF venue and downtown Miami was a small price to pay for the more-than-economic rent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day one started off with the obvious: beaching. And despite the fact that it was only mid-March, the Miami heat (no pun intended) more than made up for what would otherwise have been a chilly water temperature. <span class="hl">Sunny Isles Beach</span> was a little detached from the more populated beaches, but it was all the better for us, considering how vast the beaches were and how relaxed the atmosphere was. After a beachside lunch at one of the Trump Towers (we're by no means his supporters, but boy was that building nice), it was time to get our feet wet - literally. These photos mostly speak for themselves.

        After a quick change of cloths (and an unfortunate Lyft scam), we were on our way to what we'd waited on for a good 6 months - <span>the party of our lives.</span> The event itself had begun at noon, but we had already decided that weren't going to stand there for 10+ hours. Besides, the more famous DJs were set to begin playing around 6PM anyways, so we weren't too sad about missing out on the first half of Ultra.

        What struck me first and foremost was the <span class="hl">sheer number of people</span> in the waiting line. Not the actual venue, but the <em>waiting line.</em> It was probably the most packed place I'd ever seen in my entire life, and we ended up waiting almost a full hour just to get into the stages. The fact that there were drunk random people all around us didn't really make matters any better, either.
