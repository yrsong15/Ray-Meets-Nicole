      <h1 class="title">Chapter Four: Back At It Again</h1>

      <p>
        Fall semester was when we had established who we were and what we did. Spring semester was when we fully lived the world we had created. You can bet that many rules were broken along the way.

        Spring semester was supposed to be much more lax than its fall counterpart, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that we had taken the entire semester to settle in. As a result, Nicole had secured an internship, I had adjusted back to college life, and the path to a quiet 4 months seemed to be paved out for us. <span class="hl">How naive.</span>
      </p>

        As always, long-distance was the name of the game. Flowers and perfume did their share of the magic, but obviously no amount of material gifts could make up for the fact that we weren't physically together. Interestingly enough, these beautiful pictures of Nicole somehow belie the hardship that we had endured all throughout winter - just sit and watch.

        The numbing cold was definitely getting to Nicole, who disliked even the slightest hint of chills in the air. The quarter system dealt its blow as well, which meant that she would be <span class="hl">taking final exams as I was preparing for my first midterm.</span> I myself was going through a combination of tough coursework and the strain of securing something for my own summer plans, which led to its own share of anxiety.

        But this semester was unlike the former in that for once, our school schedules had finally aligned, and we would end up spending two whole weeks with one another, the first half in wherever we wanted to be (the second half was to be spent in Durham due to my spring break concluding much earlier than hers). That location, as was decided back in October, was none other than Miami, headlined by the three-day <span class="hl">Ultra Miami</span>, also known as the <span class="hl">biggest party in the world</span> (or one of them, at least, but you know how slogans go).
