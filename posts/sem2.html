      <h1 class="title">Chapter Four: Back At It Again</h1>

      <p>
        Fall semester was when we had established who we were and what we did. Spring semester was when we fully lived the world we had created. You can bet that many rules were broken along the way.
      </p>

        Spring semester was supposed to be much more lax than its fall counterpart, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that we had taken the entire semester to settle in. As a result, Nicole had secured an internship, I had adjusted back to college life, and the path to a quiet 4 months seemed to be paved out for us. <span class="hl">How naive.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, long-distance was the name of the game. Flowers and perfume did their share of the magic, but obviously no amount of material gifts could make up for the fact that we weren't physically together. Interestingly enough, these beautiful pictures of Nicole somehow belie the hardship that we had endured all throughout winter - just sit and watch.

        The numbing cold was definitely getting to Nicole, who disliked even the slightest hint of chills in the air. The quarter system dealt its blow as well, which meant that she would be <span class="hl">taking final exams as I was preparing for my first midterm.</span> I myself was going through a combination of tough coursework and the strain of securing something for my own summer plans, which led to its own share of anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
        But this semester was unlike the last one in that for once, our school schedules had finally aligned, and we would end up spending two whole weeks together, the first half in the city of our choice (the second half was to be spent in Durham due to my spring break concluding much earlier than hers). That location, as was decided back in October, was none other than Miami, headlined by the three-day <span class="hl">Ultra Miami 2016</span>, also known as the <span class="hl">biggest party in the world</span> (or one of them, at least, but you know how slogans go). By no means were the tickets cheap, but we figured that it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime things that had to be done when we had the time and energy.

        The trip started off surprisingly smooth on <span class="hl">March 18, 2016</span>. Our AirBnB host was extremely gracious, much more than what we'd expected, which really made us feel home. Upon first meeting her in a fashion district, she showed us around a rather fancy exhibit, followed by a late-night tour of the shoreside hotels on our way back home. The place itself was of impressive quality as well, especially considering how they were essentially one-fifth of the price we would have had to paid in hotels. The downside was distance, but we felt that a 20-minute drive from the UMF venue and downtown Miami was a small price to pay for the more-than-economic rent.

        Day one started off with the obvious: beaching. And despite the fact that it was only mid-March, the Miami heat (no pun intended) more than made up for what would otherwise have been a chilly water temperature. <span class="hl">Sunny Isles Beach</span> was a little detached from the more populated beaches, but it was all the better for us, considering how vast the beaches were and how relaxed the atmosphere was. After a beachside lunch at one of the Trump Towers (we're by no means his supporters, but boy was that building nice), it was time to get our feet wet - literally. These photos mostly speak for themselves.

      <p class="caption">Yes, it was a little windy that day</p>
      <p>
        After a quick change of cloths (and an unfortunate Lyft scam), we were on our way to what we'd waited on for a good 6 months - <span>the party of our lives.</span> The event itself had begun at noon, but we had already decided that weren't going to stand there for 10+ hours. Besides, the more famous DJs were set to begin playing around 6PM anyways, so we weren't too sad about missing out on the first half of Ultra.
      </p>
      <div class="line">

      <p>
        What struck me first and foremost was the <span class="hl">sheer number of people</span> in the waiting line. Not the actual venue, but the <em>waiting line.</em> It was probably the most packed place I'd ever seen in my entire life, and we ended up waiting almost a full hour just to get into the stages. The fact that there were drunk random people all around us didn't really make matters any better, either. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After withstanding a full hour of being surrounded by sweaty and obviously drunk people, we finally made it through the line - and boy, was it something else. Not only was it the most packed place ever, but it also had the most festive vibe of anywhere I'd ever been in. People were ready to party left and right, and it seemed as if no one gave a f*** about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main stage was set to begin with <span class='hl'>Kygo</span>, whom I regrettably did not know very well back then. Funny thing is, we had no idea just how vast the venue was, and we'd legitimately thought that one of the front stages - an introductory one, as it turned out to be - was the main stage. It was only after a full hour that we realized that the place was too unpopulated to be the main stage, and thus began the hunt for the golden trophy (or the golden stage, but you know what I mean). Oh, but not before snatching a really nice photo.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/sem2/dayone.jpg">
      <p>
        The main stage was one for the ages. Yes, we did miss Kygo, but we wound up with <span class="hl">Kaskade, Armin van Buuren, and DJ Snake</span> - not bad substitutes. Honestly, we would have stuck around for the last DJ, Martin Garrix, if it weren't for the crisis that had occurred: while jumping up and down in the main stage like a maniac, <span class="hl">I lost my wallet.</span> 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a crisis, not only because of what it was, but also because Nicole's credit card refused to work in Florida, which meant we had no actual way of paying for anything. The silver living, albeit a really close one, was that our passports had dropped out of my pocket as well, but the people next to me were attentive enough to pick them up and hand them over to us. It still gives me chills whenever I think of that moment, and what would have happened if the passport on the ground had not been caught in the corner of those people's eyes. But enough of what might have happened.

        Thanks to Lena's graciousness, we were able to get temporary cards from the nearby mall to resume spring break. UMF Day 2 was the big day, headlined by basically every big-name DJ there was in this world. We started off with some of the best food we had in Miami, a surprise bestowed upon us by Yelp. I distinctly remember the day because <span class="hl">Duke beat Yale</span> in the NCAA tournament, putting an end to the so-called Sperry Showdown.

        The lineup for Day 2 still makes me reminisce just how great the day was: <span class="hl">Tiesto, Afrojack, Avicii, and Hardwell.</span> It was a long day, that's for sure, but in retrospect the sore legs and fatigue have given way to the sheer amount of fun we'd had on that day. To me, these people were the ones responsible for the music that had helped me get through particularly tough times in the military, so to be able to see them live was pretty special. Afrojack in particular just killed it with everything he played - <span class="hl">The Spark</span> and <span class="hl">Ten Feet Tall</span> in particular were the climax of the night, if not the entire vacation. It was also memorable how one of the hotels had a full-size LED on one of its walls in the shape of a dancer playing along to the Ultra music. And of course, great pictures came with the great party that it was.

        This guy just nailed it so well, he deserves a special shoutout. Drinking out of a ducky - that's just pure genius.

        And just like that, the last day in Miami had come. We started off with a visit to <span class="hl">Lincoln Road Mall</span>, where the major takeaway was, of all things, fruit froyo (it really was that good. The exquisite flavors were honestly very surprising, almost mind-blowing).

      <p>
        The last day in UMF was headlined by none other than <span class="hl">David Guetta</span>, the man himself. As soon as he played Bang My Head my instantaneously lost it - God I love that song. We also came to realize how exciting the other stages were, so we started venturing off to the smaller stages, which we ended up enjoying a lot more than we'd thought.

        And with that, Miami had come to an end. Normally we would have been sad to see the vacation end - and we kind of were, but not really. Because what followed was a whole week of extended vacation, this time at Duke. It really was the good times. That being said, it was our first - and until now, only - extended break that the two of us had entirely to ourselves, without anything bothering us. As we bid farewell to Miami, I remember us discussing when the next time we would spend such a long time away together would be. We have yet to know, but one thing we do know for sure: <span class="hl">that it paved the way for the first of many journeys to come.</span>
