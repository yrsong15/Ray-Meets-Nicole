      <h1 class="title">Chapter Five: Tale of Two Cities</h1>
      <p>
        Like it or not, our relationship owes a lot to Expedia and the Dartmouth Coach. It had to be that both schools are located well remotely from the so-called major cities, which is why transportation is a <span>major</span> issue - major, as in well above 6-7 hours to get from one school to another. This is a story about all the mileage we've accumulated over the past year.

        Post-Miami was literally the only time we had taken an airplane together. It was nice to know how short the ride felt together, as opposed to the sheer amount of time we had to spend alone in the bus/plane otherwise. Unfortunately I had a midterm and a major project coming up the week after Spring Break (professors are really cruel that way), so we had to split whatever time we'd had to explore the Duke campus and spend time together.

        Nicole and I were quite literally singing hymns about cherry blossoms for some time now. It happened to be one of our favorite flowers (my personal favorite; her number one flowers are yellow tulips), and they look really good, above anything else. Thankfully, the North Carolina sun had warmed up enough to beget the white-pink flowers by the time late March had arrived, and all credits for the following pictures go to the sun above.

        The temperate weather also meant a lot of time in the Duke Gardens, a Duke landmark that's famous for being picturesque. For obvious reasons it's one of Nicole's favorite spots on campus, which explains the massive numbers of photos that we have from within the garden. Sometimes we just went out and lay there, <span>no agenda whatsoever</span>, just because the weather was so nice. You would, too, if your sun was this nice.

        Other times we spent visiting nearby restaurants and malls - most notably Southpoint, which is a metropolis compared to the rather rustic standards our schools have forced upon us. Just look how happy we look - two country students out in the city!

        Durham, for God knows why, happens to be one of the <span>foodiest cities in the US</span>. This means that despite the number of places we've already been to, there are tens, maybe even hundreds of places that we have yet to visit. But that doesn't mean we haven't been cutting slack; in fact, we go as far as to visit three places in one evening.

        The festivals that occasionally take place are good letouts as well. This one was the international food fest at Duke, which I had no idea was happening, but ended up being pretty enjoyable in the end. Nicole sure enjoyed the funnel cakes, which was a first-time thing for her.

        But despite all that's taken place at Duke, my favorite by far has to be my birthday party. The day started off with rendezvous shopping at a grocery store, because after having weighed two options of either cooking spaghetti for ourselves or going out to get steak, we decided on the former, for memory's sake. We'd struggled to figure out what we needed, let alone where to get it. But hey, we got a cute picture while we were at it.

        Cooking was not much better performance-wise, in that we probably had no idea what we were doing. I seem to remember a lot of thinking and discussing, but not much of the actual cooking. A lot of credit goes to the marinara sauce in the can, which essentially did most of the cooking for us.
